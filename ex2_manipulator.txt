1- first we print the camera conffiguration with print_camera_config = 1 (line 8)
2- we copy the values printed in terminal and past them to ## CAMERA CONFIGURATION 
3- now the view is set. start to set manipulator position
we set the first joint position to o and the second joint opsition to 90 degree 
run the code and see the positions
after closing simulation comment these line to set range and starting points to q0 and q1
4- we set the range and initial and final values for q0 and q1 and then we initialie them
5- we set indexed q values to qpos values to insert that values to simulation
then we define index i outside and set to 0
then with mj.forward everytime the data updates model moves
then comment mj.mj_step(model, data)
then we need to create a time value because data.time is for step function
then we define time and dt the incerement
then we define an if
